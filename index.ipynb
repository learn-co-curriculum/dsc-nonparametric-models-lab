The algorithm to find the nearest records is distance-based, so it matters that distances are all on the same scale.\n", "* **Key hyperparameters:** `n_neighbors` (how many nearest neighbors to find; too few neighbors leads to overfitting, too many leads to underfitting), `p` and `metric` (what kind of distance to use in defining \"nearest\" neighbors)\n", "\n", "#### Decision Trees - [documentation here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier.html)\n", "\n", "Similar to linear models (and unlike kNN), this algorithm emphasizes learning the relationship between the features and the target.

Producing a prediction with a decision tree means applying several conditional statements, which is slower than something like logistic regression but faster than kNN.\n", "* **Requires scaling:** No. This model is not distance-based. You also can use a `LabelEncoder` rather than `OneHotEncoder` for categorical data, since this algorithm doesn't necessarily assume that the distance between `1` and `2` is the same as the distance between `2` and `3`.\n", "* **Key hyperparameters:** Many features relating to \"pruning\" the tree. By default they are set so the tree can overfit, and by setting them higher or lower (depending on the hyperparameter) you can reduce overfitting, but too much will lead to underfitting.
